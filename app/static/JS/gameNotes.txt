Purpose: This is a document outlining how game.js functions so far.

1. Canvas (Game board)
There is a canvas tag in game.html which goes by the id = "Canvas"
    <canvas id="Canvas"></canvas>
    - This functions as the base of the game.
    Core gameplay loop:
    
    function gameLoop() is where the game is looping so that the canvas can update every tick.

2. Movement
The variable keyPressed stores all current events into a set so if a player hits multiple buttons at once,
the program can still calculate position and react with the updatePosition() function
    - This is currently using wasd

    addEventListener("keydown", (e) =>) / addEventListener("keyup", (e) =>)
    - When a player hits/releases a key, this detects it and adds/deletes the key that was hit from the set

    updatePosition()
    - Updates position

3. Timer
There is a timer set to 30secs which will count down and reset itself when reaching 0
There is an element in the html which is using this to display the timer (id = "timer")
    <span id="timer">00:30</span>

    
    3b. Answer Detection
    At the end of 30sec, the program will get two things: the color value the player is currently standing on and the player position
    
    Note: I don't know which one would be better for detecting the answer the player has chosen so I'm currently printing both of them to console


Possible bugs/features
- Player can leave canvas (Can we just call them stupid and kill them if they're not on the answer by the end?)
